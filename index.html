    <h2>What is a light year ?</h2>

    Light year is basically the amount of distance light travel in a year. Its an astronomical unit. Similarly we also 
    have terms as Light months, Light Hours, Light Minutes, Light seconds etc. But on the Universe scale we use Light 
    Years. Abbreviations used for light-years and multiples of light-years are<br><br>

    <ul>
        <li>"ly" for one light-year</li>
        <li>"kly" for a kilolight-year (1,000 light-years)</li>
        <li>"Mly" for a megalight-year (1,000,000 light-years)</li>
        <li>"Gly" for a gigalight-year (1,000,000,000 light-years)</li>
    </ul><br><br>

    <b>This is the distance from Sun to Alpha Centauri (neartest star to earth after sun)</b><br><br>

    <h2>Example : </h2>

    Distance traveled by light in 1 Year = 94.6x10<sup>12</sup> km<br>

    <h2>Explained below :</h2>

    Speed of Light = 3x10<sup>8</sup>m/s<br>

    OR 3x10<sup>6</sup>km/sec
    <br><br>

    Time required for light to cover 94.6x10<sup>12</sup>km (obtained by speed of light x total seconds in 1 year) = 1 Year.<br><br>

    We have formula, <br><br>

    Speed = Distance / Time <br><br>

    Similarly, <br>
    
    Distance = Speed x Time and <br><br>

    Time = Distance / Speed<br><br>

    For the concept of light, we can use <br><br>

    c = ly / year <br><br>

    For 1 Light Year (ly)<br><br>

    1ly = c x 1year<br><br>
    1ly = 94.6x10<sup>12</sup>km<br><br>
