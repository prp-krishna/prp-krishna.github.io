    <h2 class="head">6. Fermi Paradox</h2>
    <div class="statement">The Fermi Paradox explains all the possible reasons why we haven't found any intelligent life 
    in the universe. Fermi paradox is named after Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi. 
    There are billions of stars in the Milky Way similar to the Sun. With high probability, some of these stars have 
    Earth-like planets. Many of these stars, and hence their planets, are much older than the Sun. If the Earth is 
    typical, some may have developed intelligent life long ago. Some of these civilizations may have developed 
    interstellar travel, a step humans are investigating now. Even at the slow pace of currently envisioned interstellar 
    travel, the Milky Way galaxy could be completely traversed in a few million years. And since many of the stars 
    similar to the Sun are billions of years older, the Earth should have already been visited by extraterrestrial 
    civilizations, or at least their probes. However, there is no convincing evidence that this has happened</div>
    
    <div class="pr">There are roughly 10,000 galaxies for every grain of sand on earth. Even if we consider that 0.1% 
    planet have life there would be 1 million planets with life in milky way. Here are some speculation that 
    where are all the extraterrestrial life on the basis of The Great Filter<br>
    <ol>
        <li>The filter is behind us :
        <br>Maybe the evolution life itself is so much rare than not all can reach at this level. We maybe one of the 
            first if not the first civilization that has achieved this form of life. </li>
        <li>The filter is ahead of us : 
        <br>Thats a bad news for us. If the filter is ahead of us then we maybe near of getting eliminated. Maybe a 
            experiment that lights up all our atmosphere or a button that will serve humanity for rest of the years. 
            or the robotic AI killing their creator accidently or intensionally. If thats so then there might be some 
            secrets what are good not to be discovered. As after discovering or in an attempt to discover the secret 
            we may wipe the whole sepies all in once.
        </li>
